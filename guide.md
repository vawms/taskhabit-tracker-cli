Okay, absolutely! Let's enhance the project description by explicitly linking the development steps to the specific concepts you'd be learning from the SDF-Fundamentals, SDF-Practices, and basic SDF-SEP.

This will help you track your progress and ensure you're engaging with the intended course material as you build the project.

**Project: Personal Task & Habit Tracker (Self-Study Course Replacement)**

**Goal:** To learn and apply fundamental programming concepts, practices, and basic ethical considerations by designing, writing, testing, and debugging a command-line Task & Habit Tracker application in Python. This project replaces traditional coursework by requiring you to learn concepts as needed to implement features.

**Core Skill Focus:** **Develop** (Design, Write, Test, Debug)

**Project Breakdown & Concepts Learned:**

**Phase 1: Basic Task Management & Core Loop**

*   **Feature:** Implement a main loop that continuously prompts the user for action (e.g., Add Task, View Tasks, Quit).
    *   **Concepts Learned (SDF-Fundamentals):**
        *   `while` loops (Iterative statements) for continuous operation.
        *   `input()` for getting user commands (Basic I/O).
        *   `print()` for displaying menus and results (Basic I/O).
        *   `if`/`elif`/`else` (Conditional statements) for selecting actions.
        *   Variables (`str`) to store user input.
        *   Basic program structure and flow of control.
*   **Feature:** Allow users to add task descriptions. Store these tasks temporarily in memory.
    *   **Concepts Learned (SDF-Fundamentals):**
        *   Variables (`str`) to store task descriptions.
        *   Data Structures: Using a Python `list` to hold the tasks.
        *   Assignment operator (`=`).
        *   Basic list operations (e.g., `append`).
*   **Feature:** Allow users to view all currently added tasks.
    *   **Concepts Learned (SDF-Fundamentals):**
        *   `for` loops (Iterative statements) to iterate through the task list.
        *   `print()` to display each task.
        *   Accessing elements within a list.
*   **Practice Focus (SDF-Practices):**
    *   Start using an IDE: Get comfortable writing, running, and saving your `.py` files.
    *   Initial Debugging: Learn basic debugging by reading error messages and using `print()` statements strategically to see variable values.

**Phase 2: Enhanced Task Details & Manipulation**

*   **Feature:** Modify task storage to include more details (e.g., task description `str`, completion status `bool`, priority `int`). Use dictionaries for each task.
    *   **Concepts Learned (SDF-Fundamentals):**
        *   Data Structures: Dictionaries (`dict`) for key-value storage.
        *   Primitive Data Types: `bool`, `int`, alongside `str`.
        *   Structuring data: Representing a real-world entity (a task) with multiple attributes.
*   **Feature:** Implement "Mark Task as Done" and "Remove Task".
    *   **Concepts Learned (SDF-Fundamentals):**
        *   Modifying data structures: Changing values within dictionaries (`task['done'] = True`), removing items from lists (`tasks.remove(task)` or `del tasks[index]`).
*   **Feature:** Implement viewing only pending or completed tasks.
    *   **Concepts Learned (SDF-Fundamentals):**
        *   Using conditional logic (`if`) inside loops for filtering.

**Phase 3: Persistence with File I/O**

*   **Feature:** Save the current list of tasks (including details) to a file (e.g., `tasks.txt` or `tasks.csv` or `tasks.json`) when the user quits.
    *   **Concepts Learned (SDF-Fundamentals):**
        *   File I/O: Opening files (`open()`), writing to files (`write()`), closing files (or using `with open(...)`).
        *   String formatting/manipulation: Converting your dictionary/list data into a storable string format.
*   **Feature:** Load tasks from the file when the program starts. If the file doesn't exist, start with an empty list.
    *   **Concepts Learned (SDF-Fundamentals):**
        *   File I/O: Reading from files (`read()`, `readline()`, `readlines()`).
        *   String parsing: Splitting lines, converting parts back into appropriate data types (`int()`, `bool()`).
        *   Populating data structures from file data.
*   **Feature:** Add basic error handling for file operations (e.g., file not found during load, permission errors).
    *   **Concepts Learned (SDF-Fundamentals):**
        *   Exception Handling: `try`/`except` blocks.
*   **SEP Focus (SDF-SEP):**
    *   *Responsibility:* What happens if your save/load logic is buggy and corrupts the user's data? Reflect on the programmer's responsibility for data integrity, even in simple applications.

**Phase 4: Habit Tracking Features**

*   **Feature:** Implement functionality to add/define recurring habits. Store them (perhaps in a separate list or dictionary, potentially saving to a different file).
    *   **Concepts Learned (SDF-Fundamentals):**
        *   Reinforces data structure design, file I/O, modularity (separating task/habit logic).
*   **Feature:** Implement logging habit completion for the current day. Track streaks or counts.
    *   **Concepts Learned (SDF-Fundamentals):**
        *   Working with numbers (`int`).
        *   Updating stored data.
        *   (Optional) Simple date/time concepts (can start with string representation or explore the `datetime` library).

**Phase 5: Improving Structure and Practices**

*   **Feature:** Refactor the entire codebase using functions extensively. Aim for small, single-purpose functions.
    *   **Concepts Learned (SDF-Fundamentals):**
        *   Function definition, parameter passing (passing lists/dictionaries), return values, variable scope (local vs. passed data), abstraction, modularity.
*   **Practice Focus (SDF-Practices):**
    *   Testing: Design and document specific test cases. *How would you test adding a task? Marking one done? Loading an empty file? Loading a corrupt file?* Write simple test scripts or functions if comfortable.
    *   Debugging: Utilize the IDE's debugger – set breakpoints, step through function calls, inspect variable values during execution.
    *   Readability: Apply Python style conventions (PEP 8). Ensure variable/function names are clear.
    *   Documentation: Write clear docstrings for each function explaining its purpose, parameters, and return value. Add comments for non-obvious code sections. Create a README file explaining the project.
*   **SEP Focus (SDF-SEP):**
    *   *Intellectual Property/Code Use:* If you looked up how to parse a CSV file or handle JSON, how should you acknowledge that source, even if it's just standard documentation or a Stack Overflow post? Discuss the difference between learning from resources and plagiarism.
    *   *Professional Ethics:* Reflect on a simple code of conduct – e.g., would it be ethical to add hidden functionality to this app without the user knowing?

**Phase 6: Recursion & Advanced Concepts (Optional Extension)**

*   **Feature:** Explore adding a feature that could benefit from recursion (e.g., searching nested categories if you added that, though it might be contrived for this project).
    *   **Concepts Learned (SDF-Fundamentals):**
        *   Recursion: Base cases, recursive steps. Tracing recursive calls.
*   **Feature:** Use an external library via an API (e.g., fetch current date/time, a quote of the day).
    *   **Concepts Learned (SDF-Fundamentals):**
        *   Using external libraries/frameworks.
        *   Basic understanding of APIs.

**Self-Guidance:**

*   **Concept First:** When implementing a feature, identify the core programming concept needed (loop, conditional, file I/O, dictionary, function).
*   **Learn Actively:** Use Python documentation (docs.python.org), tutorials (like the official Python tutorial, W3Schools, Real Python), or a good textbook to learn the *syntax and semantics* of that concept.
*   **Implement & Test:** Write the code for the feature. Test it thoroughly. Does it work as expected? What happens with unusual input?
*   **Debug:** If it doesn't work, use debugging techniques (print statements, IDE debugger) to find the error. Understand *why* it was wrong.
*   **Refactor:** Once it works, can you make the code cleaner, more readable, or better organized using functions?
*   **Reflect:** Pause occasionally to review the "Concepts Learned" for the features you've implemented. Connect your practical work back to the course objectives listed in the original syllabus. Ask yourself the SEP reflection questions.

This iterative process of identifying need -> learning -> implementing -> testing -> debugging -> reflecting is key to successfully using this project as a course replacement. Good luck!
